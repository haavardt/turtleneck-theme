    Loop through products in your Frontpage collection.
    This collection is created by default, but you must add products to it.

    See the snippet 'snippets/product-grid-collage.liquid'.

      {% for product in collections[settings.home_featured_products].products %}
        {% include 'product-grid-item' %}
      {% endfor %}
